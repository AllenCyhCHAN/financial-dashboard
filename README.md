   VITE_FUTU_INVESTMENT=0
   
   # Currencies
   VITE_BANKING_CURRENCY=USD
   VITE_INVESTMENT_CURRENCY_USD=USD
   VITE_INVESTMENT_CURRENCY_HKD=HKD
   VITE_DEBT_CURRENCY=USD
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Environment Variables
This application uses environment variables to keep your sensitive financial data secure:

- **`.env` file**: Contains your actual financial data (DO NOT commit to git)
- **`.env.example`**: Template file with example values (safe to commit)
- **`.gitignore`**: Automatically excludes `.env` files from version control

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally in your browser
- **No Backend**: No data is sent to external servers
- **Privacy First**: Your financial data never leaves your device

### Best Practices
1. **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
2. **Use `.env.example`** as a template for other developers
3. **Keep backups** of your `.env` file in a secure location
4. **Regular updates** to keep dependencies secure
